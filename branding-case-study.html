  <p class="max-length">As a skincare company, the rebrand accomplishes the aesthetic of a wellness brand. Its simplified look and elegant typeface create a sense of prestige often associated with similar brands. The bold shape, softened by the use of the lines, creates an inviting experience for the user. An overall calmness, achieved through subtle colours.</p>

    <p class="unit xs-1 max-length">This new logo creates a unified versatile brand. The logomark, as well as the wordmark can both be used in conjunction or completely on their own on multiple platforms. Both of these elements are targeted towards the product and the target audience. </p>
  </div>

  <p class="max-length">This logo carries multiple layers of meaning: the ingredients used within the product (honey and sea buckthorn), the interaction between the two ingredients, revitilizing skin, and the science and knowledge that goes into the creation of Bee by the Sea. </p>
