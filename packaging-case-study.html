    <p class="unit xs-1 m-1-2 island caption">Wahl products are world renowned for their great quality and reliability. However, their existing packaging for beard trimmers did not reflect this reputation. Instead, it cheapened the product, and was easily comparable to the cheaper and lesser quality competitors surrounding it.</p>

  <p class="max-length">While redesigning the packaging, the focus was on sustainability. The current packaging for the Wahl Lithium Ion beard trimmer is completely plastic. The exterior box is made out of Polyethylene Terephthalate, which is considered safe for recycling, however the interior plastic holding the trimmer is made out of Polystyrene, which is considered not safe for recycling and heavily discouraged to do so.

  The redesigned packaging consists of complete recycled paperboard. The paperboard significantly improves on the sustainability of the current packaging, now the entire package can be recycled. However, the upgraded design was created so that the packaging would not be thrown away, it would be continued to be used.</p>

    <p class="unit xs-1 m-1-2 island caption">Many trimmers come with a wide variety of accessories and attachments, with no where to put them. This new package offers an organized storage space for all of the elements of the trimmer. These attachments are now much more accessible, and neatly stored within an aesthetically pleasing package that can be left out in the bathroom.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="max-length">The chevron pattern was inspired by the blue, white, and red barbershop poles, where Wahl products are generally used. The trapezoidal shape of the box was created so that it can house all of the attachments in an accessible manner. The shape and pattern, now make the packaging stand out on the shelves next to the monotonous plastic packaging of
  the other brands.</p>

  <p class="max-length pad-t">The new packaging of the Wahl Lithium Ion trimmer, now reflects the quality and reputation of the product. It does so while being sustainable, as well as practical for the user to interact with.</p>
