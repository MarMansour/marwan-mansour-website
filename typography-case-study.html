    <p class="unit xs-1 max-length">Cheo Research Institute provides exceptional service and insight to the individuals and community it serves. An institution that is revered for its work and the people that work for it. A document associated with CHEO should be held in the same high regard as the institute itself and serve to reflect the standard that has become synonymous with CHEO. The 2014 annual report is designed to be a functional form of communication through the relationship between colour, form, space, and structure.</p>

  <p class="max-length">The focus of the annual report is on both the information provided and the community that the institution serves. This is reflected in the art direction of the document. The photographs chosen display the children that the instution serves. Photographs also include the workers and equipment of the hospital. These images were chosen to remind the reader for whom all of the work, facts, and numbers that they are reading about are for.

  <div class="grid">

    <p class="unit xs-1  max-length">A single orange rectangle helps to bring focus to the images. This rectangle represents the vision, values, and mission of the research institute. The juxtaposition between the photograph and the rectangle creates a connection between the community and the role that the institute serves.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="max-length">The layout used offers space for the eye to focus on the important information. The pages are simplistic in their nature with no clutter to distract or confuse from the content. The position of the text and images are reversed on every other page to create a visual rhythm. Large images work as section seperators, as well as a balance for the heavy amount of text on the page. The colours of the CHEO logo are used as accents on the titles and subheaders, as to not overwhelm the reader with large colour blocks. The colour choices are consistent with the brand, creating a hierarchy throughout the pages.</p>

  <p class="max-length pad-t">The 2014 CHEO Research Institute annual report presents the information in a professional, readable, and aesthetically pleasing manner.</p>
